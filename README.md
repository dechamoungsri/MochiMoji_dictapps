I made this project as a hobby. However, I cannot finish it because I don't have a time to do it. My Ph.D. course is so tough. 

I decided to upload the code for showing a recruiter about my skill in iOS development. If you are a recruiter, please consider to hire me. I am a Tokyo-based programmer. I don't have a money to buy a suit (or food) for company interview, and my Japanese does not well enough to get a job in Japanese' s company. 

If you are a programmer, don't try to read this code because it is so messy (this is one person project). Don't waste your time.
